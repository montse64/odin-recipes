		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>Mochi muffins are a delicious and unique twist on the traditional mochi and muffins.</p>
		<p>Luckily, they are made with mochiko, also known as glutinous rice flour, which makes</p>
		<p>it much easier to make. It also gives them a chewy and slightly sweet texture.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>One of the best things about mochi muffins is that they are extremely versatile.</p>
		<p>You can add in a variety of mix-ins to customize the flavor to your liking. Some</p>
		<p> popular options include chocolate chips, fruit, nuts, and even savory ingredients</p>
		<p>like cheese and bacon.</p>
