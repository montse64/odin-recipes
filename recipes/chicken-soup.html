		<h2>Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (4-pound; 1.8 kg) whole chicken</li>
			<li>3 quarts (2.8 L) cold or room-temperature homemade chicken stock or store-bought low-sodium chicken broth</li>
			<li>6 medium cloves garlic</li>
			<li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
			<li>1 bay leaf</li>
			<li>1 large carrot (8 ounces; 230 g), diced</li>
			<li>1 medium turnip (7 ounces; 200 g), peeled and diced</li>
			<li>1 medium yellow onion (9 ounces; 250 g) or 1 large leek (white and light-green parts only), diced</li>
			<li>1 large parsnip (10 ounces; 285 g), peeled and diced</li>
			<li>2 medium ribs celery (5 ounces; 150 g), diced</li>
			<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
			<li>Minced fresh dill, flat-leaf parsley, or other fresh herbs, to finish</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Steps:</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Using a sharp knife, cut chicken breasts from breastbone and detach chicken legs from carcass.</p>
				<p>In a large soup pot or Dutch oven, cover chicken breasts, legs, and carcass with stock. Add garlic, thyme, and bay leaf.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Heat stock over medium-high heat until temperature reaches between 150°F and 160°F (66 and 71°C);</p>
				<p>adjust heat to maintain stock temperature in the 150°F–160°F range. Try to keep it above 150 and below 170°F (77°C).</p>
				<p>Cook until thickest part of chicken breasts registers 150°F on an instant-read thermometer, about 1 hour.</p> 
				<p>Remove chicken breasts and set aside.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Bring soup to a simmer and continue cooking for 1 hour longer, skimming as needed. Discard thyme sprigs and bay leaf.</p>
				<p>Remove all chicken from pot. Pull meat from bones, shredding it into bite-size pieces; discard skin and bones.</p>
				<p>If broth is cloudy, you can strain it through a fine-mesh strainer to clarify it.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Return all chicken to pot except breast meat and return to a simmer. Add diced carrot, turnip, onion (or leek), parsnip,</p>
				<p>and celery and cook until just tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Add minced fresh herbs and remove from heat.</p>
				<p>Dice chicken breasts and stir into soup along with any accumulated juices. Serve hot.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
