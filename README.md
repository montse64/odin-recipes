# odin-recipes
This is my first project as web developer.
The goal is to build a web page about recipes.

I'll try to build it with my basic knowdlege of HTML, by using
headers, lists, images, links... Basic tools I'm just learning.
	
I'll try to follow best practices. and to commit early and often

This is my startpoint and I'm very excited.
